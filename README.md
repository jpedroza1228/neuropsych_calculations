# Neuropsych_calculations
This repo is for a shiny application that uses psychological assessments and normative scores to examine for potential cognitive deficits. The shiny app can be found [here](https://jp-shinyapps.shinyapps.io/neuropsych_calculations/) and uses the patient's raw score for each assessment to create tables and visualizations that place the patient into a percentile for the cognitive functioning construct measured. This app does not include any identifiable patient information and allows the user to currently put in a normative average score and the amount of variation around the average for custom populations. Future renditions will likely include different normative scores based on race/ethnicity, gender, education, age, and other identities. 

If you are interested in including additional cognitive tests to be included in the app. You can either create a pull request or add an issue.
